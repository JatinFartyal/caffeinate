# caffeinate
An `.app` file created for MAC to avoid sleeping using the built-in `caffeinate` command.

# How to use

`Download >> unzip >> System Preference >> User & Groups >> Login Items >> add this app here`

and voila, you dont need to run the command after each time you reboot, it will automatically execute when you login
and there's no exit statement, so unless it crashes, it wont exit.

NOTE: This does not avoid sleep when you close the screen flap.
